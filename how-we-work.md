  <p>The TREE Lab is comprised of several different initiatives: Graduate Student Research Group, Young Peoples Race Power and Technology group (YPRPT), Militarism, Facial Recognition Campaign with Lucy Parsons Labs, and Student Journal. We have a variety of opportunities for all students to become involved in examining the role of technology and ethics. All initiatives hold weekly or bi-weekly meetings within their group and quarterly the entire TREE Lab holds a meeting to align our objectives and reflect.</p>
  <h2>We study the intersections of race and social justice.</h2>
