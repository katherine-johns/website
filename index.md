<h2 class="underline-border">TREE Lab: Big Picture</h2>
<p>
  The Technology, Race, Ethics, and Equity (TREE) Lab aims to research the intersections between technology, race, and ethics. We create learning experiences through demonstrations of how technology affects marginalized populations for students from under-served communities.
</p>
<p>
  We position our work as inclusive, in that we endeavor to address historic and contemporary disparities in inclusivity and social, racial and economic inequity. Furthermore, we work with teachers, students, community organizations and parents, in hope of supporting the development of interdisciplinary learning opportunities through a variety of mediums.
