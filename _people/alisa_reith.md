Ally is a PhD student in Learning Sciences. As a 2019 IDEAS fellow, she is also pursuing a certificate in Integrated Data Science. Currently, her research centers on the implementation of ed-tech programs, like 1:1 computing initiatives. With education policy becoming increasingly data-driven, she is interested in how data is conceptualized and operationalized in education spaces, with particular attention to youth experiences with privacy and surveillance, and how young people are politicized (or depoliticized) in these data-laden contexts.

Ally is working toward an educational data science that embraces explicit analyses of power, enables multiple ways of knowing and being, and builds toward equitable futures that subvert the inequities forged by colonialism, white supremacy, and racial capitalism. Also an artist and musician, Ally enjoys spontaneous and improvised creative collaboration. Previously, she has built telescopes and electric guitars, directed science camps for kids, and developed museum programs as Lead Educator at Chicago Childrenâ€™s Museum.
