I am currently a junior at Northwestern studying Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, and Legal Studies. My ultimate goal is to help create ethically and morally sound technologies. I'm particularly interested in issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, political advertisement micro-targeting, and artificial intelligence.
