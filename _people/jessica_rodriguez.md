I work with the youth in the YPRPT program of the TREE lab. I am also a sociology major on the pre-medicine track. In addition, I really enjoy learning about intersectionality of fields of study such as technology and race or medicine and sociology. In the future, I hope to be able to ameliorate and empower black and brown communities.
