YPRPT (Young People’s Race Power and Tech Project), the flagship project of the TREE lab, is an afterschool program co-designed with community partners including Evanston Township High School, and three Chicago community-based organizations - Family Matters, Endangered Peace, and the Lucy Parsons Labs. Through the bridging of civics, computing, and the arts, YPRPT aims to contribute to a reimagining of what “technology learning” is and could be in an era of ubiquitous computing.
