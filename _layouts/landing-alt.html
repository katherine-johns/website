                <span class="first-character">I</span>n partnership with the 
                TREE Lab in Northwestern's School of Education and Social Policy, 
                the Block Museum presents a special online screening of three 
                documentaries produced by students of the Young People’s Race, 
                Power, and Technology (YPRPT) project. YPRPT is an afterschool 
                program, developed in partnership with community partners 
                including Evanston Township High School, Family Matters, 
                Endangered Peace, and the Lucy Parsons Labs, that brings together 
                NU undergraduate students with youth and community members to 
                jointly investigate the ethical and social dimensions of specific 
                law enforcement technologies such as facial recognition and 
                gang databases.
            </p>

            <p>
                The screening will be introduced by professors Sepehr Vakil 
                (Northwestern University) and Raphael Nash (DePaul University) 
                and then followed by a live panel discussion between the YPRPT 
                student filmmakers. The conversation will be moderated by 
                Jessica Marshall (PhD student in Learning Sciences at
                Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy).
            </p>

            <h3>Targeted</h3>
            <h4>
                Filmmakers: David Lewis, Jessica Rodriguez, Izadorius Tortuga
            </h4>
            <p>
                The documentary depicts how the gang database targets black and brown 
                young men by labeling them as gang members in a database, which they 
                can never get out of. This label causes irreparable damage to black 
                and brown communities since being in the gang database can lead to 
                eviction, not finding employment, and loss of scholarships. Because 
                the police department does not notify individuals upon their placement 
                into the database, this documentary also explores the Freedom of 
                Information Act (FOIA) as a means of self-empowerment. 
                We hope that this film causes awareness of a detrimental tool used 
                against black and brown communities.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Racial Recognition</h3>
            <h4>
                Filmmakers: Yuzuka Komiyama-Kasai, Gregory Voelkel
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the last 25 years, Facial Recognition Technology transformed from 
                a sci-fi movie gimmick to a go-to instrument used by police, 
                governments and corporations alike. Now, Facial Recognition is 
                present in our everyday lives; yet the technology is flawed, 
                posing an immediate threat to marginalized communities and, on 
                a broader scale, our Lab civil liberties. Racial Recognition 
                hopes to raise awareness and promote change within the world of 
                Facial Recognition.
            </p>

            <h3>Melting ICE</h3>
            <h4>
                Filmmakers: Eliana Chandra, Jazminé Morrow
            </h4>
            <p>
                The topic of immigration has become more prevalent over the past 
                few years. It is crucial to understand the role of ICE. They use 
                technology such as social media to aid in their efforts of deportation 
                and family separation. On the flip side, communities have taken up 
                their own defenses and use technology to protect themselves from ICE. 
                Melting Ice serves to expose ICE’s practices while uplifting and 
                informing communities.

            <h2>BreakPoint NU Launches</h2>
            <h3>June, 2020</h3>
            <p>
                As the founding members of the student journal contend:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                &ldquo;We find ourselves in a broken world, a world we often 
                attempt to fix with technology.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                We have evidence to believe that often, technology does the 
                opposite, re-entrenching us in our inequities, even without 
                malicious intent. The onset of the Information Age has not 
                solved the pernicious societal ills that have lingered with 
                us since the beginning: oppression, exploitation, inequity, 
                and all the nuanced ways in which innocent people have been 
                setup to fail in their quests to live fulfilling, satisfying, 
                and happy lives. And at what point do we break? Dreams, 
                aspirations, bodies, communities, oppressions...at what point, 
                and in which ways, is our tech contributing to, or creating, 
                our fractured world?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what our journal seeks to take apart, reassemble, 
                and hand back to you, our readers. We reanalyze technology and 
                its effects, so that we may assist you in understanding your 
                reality, and we hope this will aid us all in figuring out 
                where we should be adjusting so that when the future arrives, 
                we aren’t more oppressed than we are now. Breakpoint NU is a 
                quarterly publication, examining technologies on Northwestern’s 
                campus, Chicago, and beyond."
