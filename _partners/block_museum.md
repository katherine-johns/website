The Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art enriches teaching and learning on the campuses of Northwestern University and in the communities of their surrounding regions by: 

* Presenting art across time, cultures, and media;
* Convening interdisciplinary discussions in which art is a springboard for exploring issues and ideas; 
* Collecting art that supports the Northwestern University curriculum.
